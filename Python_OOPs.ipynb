        "### Ques1.What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects, which bundle together data(attributes) and behavior(methods).\n",
        "Main Ideas of OOP:\n",
        "1. Class\n",
        "2. Object\n",
        "3. Encapsulation\n",
        "4. Abstraction\n",
        "5. Polymorphism\n",
        "\n",
        "### Ques2.What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "Ans. Class is like a blueprint to craete objects.It defines properties(Attributes) and actions (methods) that object will have.\n",
        "Example: A Car class defines features like brand, model, and speed but doesn’t create an actual car.\n",
        "\n",
        "###Ques3.What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "Ans. Object is an instance of class, it has actual values assigned to the properties defined in the class.Example: A Toyota Corolla is an object of the Car class with specific values like brand = Toyota and model = Corolla.\n",
        "\n",
        "###Ques4.What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "Ans.Abstraction is the process of hiding unnecessary details and also show important details to user. In this way, we can hide complex implementation and exposing the required details. Abstraction can be achieved using abstract class(which can't be instaniated, means can't have its own objects) , abstract class may contain methods that are just declared and not implemented in abstract class itself, subclasses are responsible for implementing the abstract method.\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation is the process of bundling of the data and methods. It gave us concept of Access Modifiers , hides the internal data and restricts direct access.\n",
        "Focus on how Data is protected.  \n",
        "\n",
        "###Ques5. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOPH\n",
        "Ans. Inheritence allows us to inherit  the variables and methods of parent class into child class. With the concept of inheritance, one child class can reuse or extend the properties and methods of parent class.\n",
        "It avoid code duplication, Allows modification in one place instead of many.\n",
        "There are 5 types of inheritence::\n",
        "1. Single: One Child inherits from one parent.\n",
        "2. Multiple inheritance: A child inherit from multiple parents.\n",
        "3. Multilevel Inheritance :A child inherits from a parent, which itself inherits from another parent.\n",
        "4. Hierarchical Inheritance: Multiple children inherit from one parent.\n",
        "5. Hybrid Inheritance :A combination of multiple types.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Ques6.What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "Ans.(Double Underscore) methods, also called magic mrthids, are special methods in python that start and end with double underscores(__method__). We use Dunder method to Customize object behavior , Make classes act like built-in types and it enables operator overloading.\n",
        "foe ex. __init__, __str__, __repr__, __len__, __add__, __delitem__.\n",
        "Dunder methods automate and customize object behavior.\n",
        "They help define how objects interact with built-in operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Ques7.What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "Ans. Polymorphism means \"many forms.\" In OOP, it allows the same function, method, or operator to behave differently based on the object using it.Supports method overloading and method overriding.\n",
        "Types of Polymorphism\n",
        "1. Method Overriding (Runtime Polymorphism)\n",
        "A child class provides a new definition for a method from the parent class.\n",
        "2. Method Overloading (Compile-time Polymorphism)\n",
        "Defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters (Not directly supported in Python).Instead, we can achieve it using default arguments or *args.\n",
        "3. Operator Overloading\n",
        "Using operators (+, *, ==, etc.) for custom behavior in objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Ques8.How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "Ans.Encapsulation is a concept in OOP that hides data inside a class and only allows controlled access through methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python provides three types of access modifiers:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Public: Accessible everywhere\n",
        "2. Protected : Can be accessed, but should be treated as private\n",
        "3. Private: variable\tNot directly accessible outside the class.\n",
        "For ex. Encapsulation using Private Variables ::\n",
        "The __balance variable is hidden and can only be accessed using the get_balance() method in BankAccount class. In this way, Encapsulation protects data by restricting direct access.Private (__variable) and protected (_variable) attributes control access.Getter & setter methods provide controlled access.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Ques9.What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "Ans.A constructor is a special method in a class that gets automatically called when an object is created. In Python, the constructor method is named __init__().\n",
        "Initializes object properties\n",
        "Avoids manually setting attributes for every object\n",
        "Ensures every object starts with default values\n",

        "Ans. Polymorphism means \"many forms\" – it allows the same method or function to work differently based on the object calling it.It's important because:\n",
        "1. Code Reusability: Same function name works for different types of objects.\n",
        "2. Flexibility & Scalability: New classes can be added without modifying existing code.\n",
        "3. Improves Readability :Makes the code simpler and cleaner.\n",
